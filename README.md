# CSP_LabVIEW
LabVIEW recording program for TMS and PNS responses

# The codes were developed by LabVIEW 2014. Please check your LabVIEW version or runtime engine before running the codes.
We used the program to trigger TMS and PNS to induce several responses such as motor evoked potential, cortical silent period, M/F wave of median and ulnar nerve, etc.
